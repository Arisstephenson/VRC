Version 1.1.0

- Hash-based saving
	This feature ensures that you have the exact same file 
	when you load corruption settings from others. 
	If you do not have the exact same file, a file of the
	same name will be selected if it exists. In this 
	case, you will be warned that it may not be the 
	intended corruption target.

- File and directory selection dialogs now start in their
  current or previous directory

- Paths now handle spaces properly
